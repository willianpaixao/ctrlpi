CTRL+Pi
=======

Designed to be used mainly as a advertisement product, this project is a remote
controller of XBMC systems. It has Python as main language and I'm trying to
write the most elegant code that I ever made.

**CTRL+Pi** will allow transfer media files, then run in loop mode and any other
command that you want, like shutdown or list of items in the current play list.

Documentation
=============

To build the documentation, go to *doc/* folder and run::
    make html

Of course, you can change the output format to *latex*, *epub* and any other
format available by Python Sphinx.
